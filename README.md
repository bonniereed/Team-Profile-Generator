Team Profile Generator

# Description

This project generates a webpage that creates a hierarchy based on user input.
I used node and javascript to write this app. I used HTML in template literals.
I faced issues with how to make the switch statement functional.

# Installation

You'll need to have npm installed in the folder that you are running the app from.
